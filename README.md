# FavLanguageFinder
A tool where you type in a user's github username into stdin and get the most used language in their repos returned

Taken a Sunday afternoon to create but is missing proper testing of the GithubRepo and GithubUser.  I would've created an interface for the input into these two classes which meant I could test with local data instead of data fetching.
